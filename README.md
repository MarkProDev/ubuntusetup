Setup
======

This is my installation script. With it you can rapidly setup your development environment. The file is scripted with bash 4.0+.

- Git
- Gitk
- Brackets
- Sublime Text
- NodeJs
- Npm
- Nginx
- Mysql
- Php5
- Curl
- PhantomJs
- Google Chrome

- Bower
- Gulp
- Mup
- Browserify

Beyond the Ubuntus boilerplate on bashfile, I have few more lines in the end. These little tweeks can help you reduce many typing on the keyboard.

The "subl" command can be changed by "vi" or "nano" on the server.
